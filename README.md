Welcome to the Road Accident Analysis Project!  
This repository contains a complete data analytics project that explores road accident trends using visualization, machine learning, and explainable AI (SHAP). It’s perfect for showcasing your data science skills. 🚀

📌 About the Project

This project analyzes road accident data to uncover key trends and insights. It uses Python with popular libraries like pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, and scikit‑learn. ➕ We also build a machine learning model and interpret it using **SHAP values** for explainability.

pip install -r requirements.txt

4. Start Jupyter:
jupyter notebook

5. Open and run `accident_analysis.ipynb`

📊 Key Insights

- 🚧 **Accident risk rises in rainy/foggy conditions**  
  Adverse weather increases the likelihood of accidents due to reduced visibility and slippery roads.

- 🚗 **Higher speed limits correlate with severe outcomes**  
  Roads with higher speed limits tend to experience more serious and fatal accidents.

- 🛻 **Heavy vehicles (trucks/buses) show more high‑severity accidents**  
  Larger vehicles are associated with a higher proportion of severe crash outcomes.

- 🍺 **Alcohol involvement increases fatality likelihood**  
  Accidents where alcohol was involved tend to result in more fatalities.
